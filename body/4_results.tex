\chapter{Results}
\label{cha:results}
% This chapter should display the results of your experiments. It should be entirely
% factual, so leave the discussion you draw from it for the Discussion chapter.
%
% You may choose to structure your thesis slightly differently, but the overall 
% approach should be the same.
%
% 1. By now you should have already described your methodology and  evaluation 
%    procedures. There is no reason to discuss these in the results.
% 2. Do not include raw data in the results chapter, leave it for the appendix 
%    or simply don't include it. If you don't think people will refer to it it's
%    probably not worth including.
% 3. Display your results in an informative way. Charts, tables, summaries, etc.
%
% If your results form a complete chapter you can use the conclusion section to
% state how the results answer your hypothesis. If you don't have a spearate
% conclusion chapter make sure you answer the hypothesis as you go. The reader
% should have answers to these before the Discussion.
