% INTRODUCTION CHAPTER LAYOUT
%
% 1. Problem Statement: Introduce readers to the topic
%  What is the "problem"
%  Brief summary of current solution and why it is inadaquate (if applicable)
%  Why the research is worth tackling, why a solution would be significant
%
% 2. Aim: State overall research aim (try for 1 sentence)
%  Several developments / stages will be required in any research to produce a final
%    result, however remember that only the final outcome is the aim, not each stage
%    i.e. tell the reader what the aim is, not how you are going to achieve it. You
%    will explain this in more specific chapters.
%  There should only be 1 aim
%  The aim should follow as a logical consequence of the problem statement
%  You should be able to relate to this aim throughout the thesis, particularly conclusion
%  "Thus ..."
%
% 3. Scope: State scope of work
%  Be very clear what will and will not be covered. Justify why. 
%  It is okay to have persued only one of multiple accepted approaches due to limited time, 
%    but justify why you have chosen this approach over another.
%  If you want sections in this chapter, Aim & Scope can be together
%
% 4. Overview of the study: Brief chapter layout & description of work to come
%  "To achieve this Chapter ..."
%  Similar to the table of contents, but you are explaining the logical flow of 
%    your thesis to ensure the reader can see where you are going and why
%  By the end of this section the reader should understand how the aim will be
%    achieved.
%
% Do NOT include:
%  - review of literature
%  - statement of theory
%  - glossary of terms (although sometimes it is important to define terms when defining
%      the scope of your work)
%
% Most of this info is summarised from the book below. Supervisors may have other preferences,
% but I found it very helpful. I've only included short summaries in this template but if you
% are stuck buying a copy is definitely worth it :) http://www.mup.com.au/items/120101

\section{Background}
\label{sec:intro_background}
Autonomous robots have for many years been the subject of fiction, mystery and the imagination.
