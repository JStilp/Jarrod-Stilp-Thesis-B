\chapter{Future Work}
\label{cha:futurework}

In order to complete the full set of required capabilities for the commercial viability of the Gene-Plex Extractor, as outlined in Chapter \ref{cha:introduction}, this work shall be furthered. This includes the full development of the magnetic separation capabilities and their verification, the implementation of a hygeinic waste disposal method and the addition of the required routines to the platforms software.\\

Further to this, further work is required in order to fully realise the implemented discrete time controller. Such work includes the full debugging of the developed control routine in order to identify the source of the currently experienced data overflow. Following successful debugging, the fully implemented controller must be validated using an experimental setup identical to that employed in Section \ref{sec:controller_verification}. This must be conducted to ensure the response of the controller achieves the required system performance and the transient response is as expected from the Simulink simulation conducted.
