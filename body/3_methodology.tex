% The layout of your thesis is fairly flexible, so don't feel you need to follow the chapters
% in this template. It's a good idea to talk through your structure with friends and your 
% supervisor to check it is logical and flows to someone with little understanding of the content.
%
% Here is a brief outline of the structure of each chapter:
%  1. Introduction
%      - First paragraph should link this chapter to the previous chapter(s) and overall progress
%      - Follow this by stating the aim and function of this chapter (what does it add to your 
%        overall argument?). Make sure the reader knows what they should get out of it.
%      - Provide an overview of how you'll do that (perhaps what each section adds to the argument)
%  2. Body
%      - This is mostly up to you. Before you start writing make sure you WRITE DOWN what the main
%        content points and arguments are. Structure your sections in a logical way around these.
%      - Feel free to begin with a "Fundamentals" section, or weave this into the start of 
%        individual sections to provide (necessary) technical background to the areas you work in
%  3. Conclusion
%      - Don't just summarise what you did, state the significance and implications of what you found.
%      - Only state conclusions which can be made from this chapter alone. Leave the overall argument
%        and main conclusions for the Discussion and Conclusion chapters.
%
% A couple of tips:
%  - I always found it helpful to start with a few levels of dot-points (OneNote, Google Docs, Word)
%    to get the content down. Then you can easily see where it is lacking, and you can rearrange it
%    quickly to get a better structure and flow. Remember the reader understands a LOT less about this
%    than you do, so good explanations are important!
%  - Don't be afraid to start writing. Even if you think it will be garbage. Even if you're not
%    completely sure what to say. Just start. The action of writing it out will clarify your argument
%    in your own mind and help you with development. You also get to see where there is room for 
%    improvement in your argument. I wrote most of my chapters 3 times and each time it became a lot 
%    more logical and I was a lot happier with it. While I spent a more time writing, it saved me a 
%    lot of time procrastinating and wondering how to write it perfectly first time.

\chapter{Methodology}
\label{cha:methodology}

With the scope of the work now defined, the manner in which the required results will be obtained can now be detailed. The necessary additions as defined in Section \ref*{sec:intro_scope}, Scope, may will be implemented in the form of two independent assemblies in order to meet the requirements of the work. These two assemblies will be refereed to as the Processor Module and the Magnetic Separation Station. The former will be the site of the chemical reactions as described in Section \ref{subsec:intro_extraction}, The Extraction Process, and will be the hardware element that forms the SBS block on the Gene-Plex Extractor deck. Therefore, given it will house the full set of reactions, it will also encompass the software and hardware requirements of the liquid temperature control (including the associated controller), along with the magnetic separation required in tube number 4 of the cassette. The Magnetic Separation Station will be the location of disposal of the supernatant and therefore shall include the magnetic hardware required to physically manipulate the magnetic silica beads in order to retain them in the pipette tip while the waste is expelled. Given the biological nature of the liquid waste involved, this station will also include provisions for hygienically disposing of and storing this waste.

\section{Processor Module}

\subsection{Hardware}

The hardware component of the Processor Module design is concerned with ensuring the module accepts the required cassette tubes, fits within the stipulated SBS space and provides a stable platform for the required temperature control using the knowledge gained
