Most of these first few pages are generated by the file header/frontpage.tex

However, this file contains a lot of important (and messy) commands for setting up the document which should rarely need to be changed, so I've moved the abstract to a separate file (header/abstract.tex) using an \textbackslash include\{\} command.

You could do the same with acknowledgements if you wanted to.
