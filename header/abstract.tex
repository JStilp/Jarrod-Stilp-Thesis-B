This work has integrated into the AusDiagnostics Gene-Plex platform a number of key capabilities required for performing the extraction of DNA/RNA from a human sample utilizing super paramagnetic silica beads. By considerating the factors effecting a designs thermal stability, hardware capable of maintaining a stable steady state, driven temperature was developed. Through guided and iterative design, the Ferrotec 9500-035-085 B was selected for use in a pair as the heating element. Numerical simulation and experimental verification found these modules capable of exceeding the response requirements of the system. A PID controller was developed to drive the system to the required set point and was found, following calibration, to meet the stipulated requirements with a time response of 81.16 seconds and a steady state error of 0.083$\degree$C. Despite a discrete time controller being developed via the direction analytical method and validated via simulation, a software bug prevented the full experimental verification from being conducted. Via the investigation completed and preliminary experimental results, an effective means of magnetic separation has been determined.
